# amp-up-backend

This repository was created for me to play and learn a little bit about Node.js with Express.

During my studies, I developed a small application with basic CRUD operations using SQLite3 as database.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the application with `npm start`
4. The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000.`

## Technologies
* Node.js
* Express
* SQLite3
* Knex (Query Builder)
* Cors

## Scripts
* **`start`** - starts the application using **`node src/index.js`**
* **`dev`** - starts the application using **`nodemon src/index.js`** (requires nodemon to be installed as a dev dependency)

Feel free to check it out and give me feedback!
